# Junior Developer | Take Home Test

# Objective

These tasks are designed to evaluate the ability to build a backend utility that interacts with an API and a frontend application to display and manipulate the data.

There are two sub-directories, one for each task: a backend utility and a frontend utility. Each directory has their own usage guidelines.

To clone this repository
```sh
git clone
cd firstcircle-test/

Run the frontend task
```sh
